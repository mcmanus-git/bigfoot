{"name":"timothyrenner_bfro-sightings-data","title":"Bigfoot Sightings","description":"Full text and geocoded sighting reports from the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO).\n\n# About\n\nThe Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) - [www.bfro.net](www.bfro.net) - is an organization dedicated to investigating the bigfoot / sasquatch mystery.\nThis dataset contains sighting data publicly available on the BFRO website in a more digestible form.\n\n![I want to believe](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Patterson%E2%80%93Gimlin_film_frame_352.jpg)\n\nThere are three files:\n\n1. `bfro_report_locations.csv` - tabular geocoded reports\n2. `bfro_reports.json` -  full text reports in line-delimited JSON.\n3. `bfro_reports_geocoded.csv` - combined and cleaned version of the report locations and full text reports.\n\nThe dataset was collected on 4/17/19.\n\n# Reports\n\nThe most useful file in the dataset is probably `bfro_reports_geocoded.csv`.\nIt contains the most relevant fields in the full reports joined against the report locations, and also now contains the weather conditions the day of the sighting.\nThe weather conditions were obtained using the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/docs/terms).\nThere's also a little data cleaning applied to this dataset around the timestamps and lat/lon values.\nNot all of the full text reports have a corresponding geocoded report - in that case the geo information is null.\n\nEach geocoded report obviously contains a latitude and longitude value.\nIt also contains a report title, report number, and report classification.\nReport classifications are explained on the BFRO website [here](http://www.bfro.net/GDB/classify.asp), but basically the classification determines the nature of the incident - direct sighting, noises, tracks, etc.\nThere are also timestamps.\nAside from the titles, the data in this file is structured.\n\nThe full text reports contain a variety of information about the sighting such as the nearest town, other witnesses, environmental conditions, and a full, multi-paragraph description of the incident.\nNot all fields are present in all reports, which is why I chose line delimited JSON.\nThe data in this file is unstructured for the most part.\n\n# Code\n\nThe geocoded reports were pulled from a KML file available for download on the BFRO website [here](http://www.bfro.net/news/google_earth.asp).\nThe full text JSON reports were scraped from the site.\nThe weather conditions are [powered by Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/poweredby/).\n\nThe code for pulling the data can be found here: [https://github.com/timothyrenner/bfro_sightings_data](https://github.com/timothyrenner/bfro_sightings_data).\n\nI wrote a blog post with a geospatial analysis: [Finding Bigfoot](https://timothyrenner.github.io/datascience/2017/06/30/finding-bigfoot.html).\n\nI also wrote an app using the Plotly Dash framework: [Bigfoot Dash App](https://github.com/timothyrenner/bigfoot-dash-app). It's running live [here](https://bigfoot-sightings-dash.herokuapp.com/) if you want to check it out, but it's on the Heroku free tier so YMMV in terms of performance and uptime.\n\n# Changelog\n\n* **4/18/19** Refreshed the dataset, added a `season` column to `bfro_reports_geocoded.csv`.\n* **12/2/17** Added the weather conditions to `bfro_reports_geocoded.csv`.\n* **10/25/17**  Refreshed the dataset, added `bfro_reports_geocoded.csv` file.","homepage":"https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data","license":"Public Domain","resources":[{"name":"bfro_report_locations","schema":{"fields":[{"name":"number","title":"number","description":"The report number as an integer.","type":"integer","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer","dwSourceId":"number"},{"name":"title","title":"title","description":"The full title of the report.","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"title"},{"name":"classification","title":"classification","description":"The sighting classification for the report.","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"classification"},{"name":"timestamp","title":"timestamp","description":"The time of the report in ISO-8601 format.","type":"datetime","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTimeStamp","dwSourceId":"timestamp"},{"name":"latitude","title":"latitude","description":"The latitude of the sighting.","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"latitude"},{"name":"longitude","title":"longitude","description":"The longitude of the sighting.","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"longitude"}]},"path":"data/bfro_report_locations.csv","format":"csv"},{"name":"bfro_reports","schema":{"fields":[{"name":"year","title":"YEAR","description":"The year of the sighting in no particular format.","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"year"},{"name":"season","title":"SEASON","description":"The season of the sighting.","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"season"},{"name":"state","title":"STATE","description":"The state or province of the sighting.","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"state"},{"name":"county","title":"COUNTY","description":"The county of the sighting.","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"county"},{"name":"location_details","title":"LOCATION_DETAILS","description":"A detailed description of the location.","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"location_details"},{"name":"observed","title":"OBSERVED","description":"A detailed description of the incident.","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"observed"},{"name":"other_witnesses","title":"OTHER_WITNESSES","description":"A description of other witnesses present.","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"other_witnesses"},{"name":"time_and_conditions","title":"TIME_AND_CONDITIONS","description":"The conditions and time of the sighting.","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"time_and_conditions"},{"name":"report_number","title":"REPORT_NUMBER","description":"The report number.
